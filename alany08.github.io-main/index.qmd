Hello there! Welcome to my personal blog, where I (will) post cool stuff I find, my
opinions and thoughts, and some stuff that interests me. My content will most likely
be centered around math, physics, and writing cuz our universe is a beautiful thing, and the 
best way to show our appreciation is by constantly challenging our perception of reality.

welcome to my world :)

There's currently not a lot on here, as I've recently started building this page.
