Hello there! Welcome to my personal blog, where I (will) post cool stuff I find, my
opinions and thoughts, and some stuff that interests me. I'll also try to create
interactive lessons from an intuitive standpoint for mathematics and physics. With
my belief in free and open-source, all of the contents on this website are licensed
under the MIT license unless otherwise stated.

There's currently not a lot on here, as I've recently started building this page.
